### Lab 1 is a building made in processing specifically **a house**.

### Lab 2 is a picture of stars and space with _different colors_.

### Lab 4 is a _ripple effect_ that can change background color.

### Lab 5 is a **TV** that turns white when the _on_ button is pushed and turns black when the _off_ button is pushed.

### Lab 7 is a horribly drawn tree with clouds and the sun in the background.
